    "    • Efficiency:\n",

    "    • Why Incorporate Frequency?: Adjusting cosine similarity with a frequency factor ensures that common words (which might be less informative) do not\n",
    "   dominate the similarity metric.\n",
    "    • Log Transformation: Using a logarithmic transformation of word frequency helps to dampen the effect of very frequent words. This balances the\n",

    "Overall, the choice of cosine similarity, frequency adjustment, Word2Vec embeddings, comprehensive preprocessing, relevance filtering, and PCA for visualization are well-justified. They collectively enhance the model’s ability to accurately capture and analyze the semantic relationships and similarities between words in the context of product reviews."
