    "In digital advertising, Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a critical metric that measures the effectiveness of an advertisement. It is calculated as the ratio of users who click on an ad to the number of users who view the ad. A higher CTR indicates more successful engagement with the audience, which can lead to increased conversions and revenue. From time-to-time advertisers experiment with various elements/targeting of an ad to optimise the ROI."

One of their clients has identified four key tunable elements in their ads: *Age*, *City*, *Gender*, and *Mobile Operating System (OS)*. These elements significantly influence user engagement and conversion rates. The client is keen to optimize their CTR while minimizing resource expenditure."
